He had discovered that you can create a chart with #ggplot2 in R, export it as a vectorized image (SVG), insert the image into PowerPoint, convert it to shapes, and then fully customize each chart element—axes, labels, legends, data point and so on.\\n\\nWhile exporting plots for post-processing in tools like Adobe Illustrator or Figma is common practice, I personally prefer to create everything directly in R. This way, the chart remains reproducible with new data, and others can easily adapt it to their needs. That said, I occasionally use Figma for adding annotations.\\n\\nIn science, on the other hand, replicability and reproducibility of the findings are crucial, so it’s worth being cautious. (You could even end up moving the data points around as you like.)\\n\\nI've put together a quick video demonstrating this process.\\n\\nAlthough you could create simple scatter plots like in this example directly in PowerPoint, this method can be useful when dealing with more complex charts or when extensive data preparation is required before plotting.\\n\\n#rstats #dataviz \",\n",

Instead of processing them as one big unit, this approach lets the LLM consider each doc separately and process them in parallel.\\n\\nSo it’s obvious how it improves the speed. But how does it improve the accuracy?\\n\\nA major problem in LLMs is, when there is irrelevant info in the input context, it confuses the model. So, by considering each retrieved doc separately when answering the query, this problem is reduced.\\n\\nHere’s how they actually do Superposition Prompting:\\n\\nThey use a DAG structure where each query segment is a duplicate of the original query. This allows for parallel processing of the query segments.\\n\\nThe model looks at each query segment and its retrieved docs independently, and uses path pruning to get rid of any irrelevant docs. \\n\\nTo make inference even faster, the paper uses path caching and path parallelisation techniques:\\n- Path caching precomputes KV embeddings for the docs\\n- Path parallelisation computes KV caches and logits for query segments in parallel. \\n\\nPaper: https://lnkd.in/g_j67TpY\\n\\n#AI #RAG #LLMs ',\n",
